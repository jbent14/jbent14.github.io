		<h1>Neopolitan Dreams</h1>

		<h2>Lisa Mitchell</h2>

		<p>You'll go on I'll be okay, <br />
		I can dream the rest away <br />
		Its just a little touch of fate, it will be okay <br />
		It sure takes its precious time, but it's got rights and so have I  </p>

		<p>I turn my head up to the sky <br />
		I focus one thought at a time <br />
		I do not let the little thieves under my tightly buttoned sleeves <br />
		You couldn't be alone, the time I feel like I am walking blind <br />
		I have no where I'll have time  </p>

		<p>There are no legible signs x2  </p>

		<p>I like the way that you talk, <br />
		I like the way that you walk. <br />
		It's hard to recreate such an individual game  </p>

		<p>You wait you turn in the queue, <br />
		You say your sorries and thank you's <br />
		I don't think you're ever <br />
		A hundred percent in the room <br />
		You're not in the room x2  </p>

		<p>Deepest, of the dark nights <br />
		here lies, the highest of highs <br />
		Neopolitan Dreams, stretching out to the sea  </p>

		<p>You wait you turn in the queue, <br />
		You say your sorries and thank yous <br />
		I don't think you're ever <br />
		A hundred percent in the room <br />
		You're not in the room x2  </p>
